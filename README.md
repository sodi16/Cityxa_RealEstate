# Cityxa - Real Estate Django Website

This is a Django-based real estate website designed to showcase properties for sale or rent. It allows users to search for properties using various filters such as location, price, number of bedrooms, property type and more. The project includes two applications: one for managing user accounts and another for managing properties.

I also use Google API for maps display and real adress search on globe.
