# Cityxa - Real Estate Django Website

This is a Django-based real estate website designed to showcase properties for sale or rent.<br/>
It allows users to search for properties/houses using various filters like location, price, number of bedrooms, property type, superficie and more. The project includes two applications: one for managing user accounts and another for managing properties.
<br/>
I use Google API for maps display and real adress, places search on globe.
